# Data-Analysis-of-Blood-Transfusion-Center-using-principal-component-analysis-Project-INSE-6220

The data plays an important role in this advancement. Here we are emphasizing data analysis for healthcare organizations. While a doctorâ€™s skills and diagnosis are important in medicine, with data science, knowledge of data and prediction plays a crucial role. The donation of blood can save people, especially those who are cancer patients or people who have met with an accident. Therefore, there is a need for a system to track and predict donations which in turn can make sure more people get the blood transfusions they need. Thus, this problem can be seen as a classification task. In particular, we are building a predictive model to determine whether a blood donor gave blood in a certain time based on different characteristics of the input parameters.

The report is structured as follows: 
1) Detailed information about the data.
2) The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is introduced and analysis is carried out. 
3) Trains and tests the build prediction model and the results of implementations are provided. 
4) Finally the conclusion part of the work.
